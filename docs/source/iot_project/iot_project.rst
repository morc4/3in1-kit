IoT Projects
====================

This kit has the ESP8266 Wifi module which allows Arduino to connect to the internet for IoT experiments.

Here we will guide you how to make Arduino connect to `BLYNK <https://blynk.io/>`_ platform with the help of ESP8266 Wifi module to do some interesting IoT projects. Also you can use the Blynk APP on your cell phone to control the smart car.


Blynk is a full suite of software required to prototype, deploy, and remotely manage connected electronic devices at any scale: from personal IoT projects to millions of commercial connected products.
With Blynk anyone can connect their hardware to the cloud and build a no-code iOS, Android, and web applications to analyze real-time and historical data coming from devices, control them remotely from anywhere in the world, receive important notifications, and much moreâ€¦
