If you have registered and logged in to your account, you will be inside the Web Editor. However, you need to install Arduino Create Agent and run it before uploading the code in Web Editor.

For detailed tutorials, please refer to: https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor.

.. warning::
    For projects that require additional libraries, they will not work in Web Editor.
